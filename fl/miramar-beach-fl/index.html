                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Miramar Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in Walton County, Florida, United States. The population was 6,146 at the 2010 census. Although many other coastal localities in Florida have appended 'Beach' to their names to distinguish themselves from an adjacent inland or cross-bay municipality – such as Miami Beach, St. Pete Beach, Fort Myers Beach, Panama City Beach, Melbourne Beach, Cocoa Beach, and Jacksonville Beach – the city of Miramar, Florida is actually over 450 miles (720 km) away in South Florida. Miramar Beach is due east of Destin, Florida. It is often considered to be part of the city of Destin. However, it has its own ZIP code (32550) and is in Walton County, whereas Destin is in Okaloosa County.</p>
