            <p>Whitfield Estates was formerly a 682-acre (276 ha) wooded area that had been homesteaded by General John Riggin, aide-de-camp to Ulysses S. Grant. The property included the 218-acre (88 ha) bayfront estate of Alfred Ringling. In 1924, the property was purchased from Richard T. Ringling, son of Alfred, by a corporation called Whitfield Estates, Inc., held by Louis Broughton Whitfield, D. G. Haley, E. H. Price, and E. S. Delaplane, Jr., all residents of Alabama.</p>
