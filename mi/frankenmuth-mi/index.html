            <h3>Frankenmuth, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The city's name is a combination of two words. Franken represents the Province of Franconia in the Kingdom of Bavaria from which the original settlers came, and the German word Mut means 'courage.' Thus, the name Frankenmuth means 'courage of the Franconians'. The most popular nickname is 'Little Bavaria', in reference to the city's German heritage.</p>
