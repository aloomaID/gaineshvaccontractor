                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>It was first established in 1834 and was originally named 'Dibbleville' after Clark Dibble, one of the first settlers. It was platted in 1837 as 'Fentonville' by William M. Fenton who would later become lieutenant-governor of Michigan. When the settlement was incorporated as a village in 1863 the name Fenton was used. The settlement's post office used the name Fentonville from 1837 until 1886, when it adopted the current name.</p>
