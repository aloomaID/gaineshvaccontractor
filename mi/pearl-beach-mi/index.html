                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>This area along the North Channel connecting Anchor Bay to the Saint Clair River was settled as early as 1796 when a dozen private land claims were made by the French. A now-defunct post office began operating here under the name Pearlbeach on August 2, 1898. Harry Bryant, who was an agent for the Detroit and St. Clair Railroad, served as the first postmaster.</p>
