            <h3>Oneonta, NY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Oneonta (/ˌoʊniˈɒntə/ OH-nee-ON-tə) is a city in southern Otsego County, New York, United States. It is one of the northernmost cities of Appalachia. Oneonta is home to the State University of New York at Oneonta and Hartwick College. SUNY Oneonta began as a normal school and a teacher's college in 1889, and Hartwick College moved into the city in 1928. The approximately 5,800 students from SUNY Oneonta and the approximately 1,500 students at Hartwick make up a significant percentage of the population of Oneonta. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Oneonta had a population of 13,079. Its nickname is 'City of the Hills.' While the word 'oneonta' is of undetermined origin, it is popularly believed to mean 'place of open rocks' in the Mohawk language. This refers to a prominent geological formation known as 'Table Rock' at the western end of the city.</p>
