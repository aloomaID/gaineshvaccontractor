                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The community is sometimes referred to as Jot-Um-Down for a former local community store that took this nickname from the Lum and Abner radio show. Landmarks in Mulberry include the Mulberry Primitive Baptist Church and cemetery, Bessie's Chapel church and Jot-Um-Down Volunteer Fire Department. A nineteenth century United States post office, named Venable, stood near here and was named for then area resident and Surry County sheriff, Stephen G. Venable.</p>
