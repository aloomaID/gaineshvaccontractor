            <h3>Kiawah Island, SC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Kiawah is a sea island, or barrier island, on the Atlantic coast of the United States. Located 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Charleston in Charleston County, South Carolina, it is primarily a private beach and golf resort. It is home to the Kiawah Island Golf Resort, with spacious villas, beaches, large and acclaimed golf courses, and other attractions. As of the 2010 census, Kiawah Island's population was 1,626, up from 1,163 at the 2000 census. The island is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area. Alternative spellings and variants of the name itself include 'Kiawa', 'Kittiwar' (in DuBose Heyward's novel Porgy), and 'Kittiwah' (in George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess). The proper pronunciation is sometimes considered difficult: the following reference provides an example pronunciation of Kiawah Island. Census Tract 21.04, located on the island, has a per capita income of $168,369, the highest in South Carolina.</p>
