            <h3>Laupahoehoe, HI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>On April 1, 1946, the Hawaiian Islands were struck by the so-called 'April Fools Day tsunami', originating from the Aleutian Islands earthquake. Approximately 159 people in the islands were killed. The tsunami had the largest impact on the Big Island, with the greatest number of deaths occurring in Hilo with 96 fatalities. The school building at Laupāhoehoe was inundated by the tsunami and 24 people drowned. Of the dead, 16 were schoolchildren, four were teachers, and four were residents. A monument to the dead now stands on Laupāhoehoe Point.</p>
