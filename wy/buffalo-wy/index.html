            <h3>Buffalo, WY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Buffalo is a city in Johnson County, Wyoming, United States. The city is located almost equidistant between Yellowstone Park and Mount Rushmore. The population was 4,415 at the 2020 census, down from 4,585 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Johnson County. The city has experienced an economic boom due to methane production from the Coal Bed Methane Extraction method used in the Powder River Basin and surrounding areas. However, with the decline of methane production, Buffalo's population has stabilized since the 2010 Census. Even though energy is a vital part of its economy, agriculture, tourism, and recreation are three other major components. Buffalo is located at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains.</p>
