            <h3>Whitestown, IN Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Whitestown was laid out in 1851 when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for Albert Smith White, a U.S. Senator from Indiana. The name of the town has at points been noted for being easily perceived as having historical ties to racism in Indiana, despite Albert S. White being known as a leading abolitionist. The first post office in Whitestown was established in 1853.</p>
