            <h3>La Caada Flintridge, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Before the city's incorporation on November 30, 1976, it consisted of the two distinct communities of La Cañada and Flintridge. The wealthy, predominantly white town has a history of racial residential segregation, as black people were prohibited from buying housing in the city. It arguably incorporated to avoid racial integration of its public schools. In 2023, the city tried to prevent construction of multi-family housing by arguing that doing so entailed desegregation, which the city's lawyers said was unconstitutional under a Supreme Court decision against affirmative action in college admissions.</p>
