            <p>Manahawkin is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Stafford Township, in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP's population was 2,413, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 110 (+4.8%) from the 2,303 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected an increase of 299 (+14.9%) from the 2,004 counted at the 2000 census. Manahawkin has been thought to be a Lenape word meaning 'land of good corn', although this has been disputed by recent scholars claiming that it translates to 'fertile land sloping into the water.'</p>
