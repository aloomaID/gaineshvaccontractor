            <p>Columbus is a village in Luna County, New Mexico, United States, about 3 miles (5 km) north of the Mexican border. It is considered a place of historical interest, as the scene of a 1916 attack by Mexican general Francisco 'Pancho' Villa that caused the United States to send 10,000 troops there in the Mexican Expedition (originally referred to as the 'punitive Mexican Expedition'). Columbus's population was 1,664 at the 2010 census.</p>
