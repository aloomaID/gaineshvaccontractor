                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Manheim was laid out by Henry William Stiegel in 1762 on a land tract in Rapho Township, though it was only incorporated in 1838. He set out to build an industrial empire and founded the Manheim Glassworks. After financial failure, he was forced to sell the development in 1775. After several failed attempts at resurrecting the glassworks, it closed in 1780.</p>
