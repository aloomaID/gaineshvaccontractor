            <h3>Glen Carbon, IL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1801, Colonel Samuel Judy received a military grant for 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land near the base of the bluffs just north of Judys Branch, and became one of the first permanent settlers of Madison County. The land was called Goshen Settlement, after the biblical land of Goshen. It was renamed 'Glen Carbon' to reflect its coal mining heritage.</p>
