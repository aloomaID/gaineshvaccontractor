            <h3>Gruver, TX Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Gruver is a city in Hansford County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,162 at the 2010 census. Farwell, in the center of Hansford County, approximately three miles east of what became Gruver, was established in 1880 by the Canott family of Illinois, and was the first town in the county. Gruver was established shortly after, and Farwell rapidly fell into oblivion after 1889, when it lost a county seat election to Hansford.</p>
