            <h3>Olive Branch, MS Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Olive Branch is the sixth-largest city in Mississippi, located in DeSoto County. As of the 2020 census, the population is 39,711. Olive Branch is part of the Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region that consists of three counties in southwest Tennessee, five counties in northwest Mississippi, and two counties in eastern Arkansas. Olive Branch was the fastest growing city in the United States, with a growth rate of 838% as of 2010 in a thirty year time frame. Along with other rapidly growing places in DeSoto County, Olive Branch attributes most of its growth and development to the exodus of large numbers of families from central Memphis.</p>
